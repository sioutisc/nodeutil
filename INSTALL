Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Firstly, make sure you have the following installed:
 - Python (>= 2.3)
 - GNOME 2
 - PyGTK 
 - Any additional gnome-python-extras or python-gnome-extras
   packages for your system.

For the awn applet, you'll also need:
 - Avant-window-navigator
 - awnlib

Extract the archive and run the following as root:

 # python setup.py install
 # killall gnome-panel

You should now be able to right-click on your GNOME panel, choose
'Add to Panel' and select the Internode Usage Meter Applet.


Good luck and enjoy!
