Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Firstly, make sure you have the following installed:
 - Python (>= 2.3)
 - GNOME 2
 - PyGTK 
 - Any additional gnome-python-extras or python-gnome-extras
   packages for your system (ubuntu 11.04: sudo apt-get install python-gnomeapplet).

For the awn applet, you'll also need:
 - Avant-window-navigator
 - awnlib

If you're reading this, you probably haven't run the self-extracting installer. You can simply download the self-extracting .sh script, mark it executable, and run it.

you can either just run './installer', or run 'sudo ./setup.sh' to install, 
then kill and restart either gnome-panel or avant-window-navigator, and the applets should become available.

You should now be able to right-click on your GNOME/Awn panel, choose
'Add to Panel' or 'applets' and select the Internode Usage Meter Applet.

Good luck and enjoy!
