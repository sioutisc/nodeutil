Internode Usage Meter for GNOME and Avant Window Navigator

By Dale Maggee

Based on Sam Polenhz's GNOME Usage Meter

GNU GPL, I suppose, given the GPL's viral nature... :( it should be BSD...

For Requirements, see the INSTALL file

run 'sudo ./setup.sh' to install, then kill and restart either gnome-panel or avant-window-navigator, and the applets should become available.

TODO:
 - make awn applet resize the icon according to panel size
